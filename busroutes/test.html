          <h1>Singapore's bus routes</h1>

          <h3>All bus stops and the routes that pass through them are visualized on the map.</h3>

          <p>Bus services can be a bi-directional service, a uni-directional service or a loop service. Bi-directional services will have routes in Direction 1 (RED) and 2 (BLUE), while uni-drectional and loop services will only have Direction 1 routes.</p>

          <h4>Note: The exact coordinates of path taken by each route is unknown. The smoothness of a route is dependent on the distance between bus stops. This explains the presence of straight lines that unrealistically cut across land in some routes.</h4>

          <h4>I downloaded the shapefile of Singapore and converted it to geoJSON. D3 was then used to render the map of Singapore based on the provided vector geographical information.</h4>

          <pre>
          var projection = d3.geoMercator().fitSize([width, height], geoJSON)
          var path = d3.geoPath().projection(projection) 

          // DRAW MAP OF SINGAPORE    
          mapWrapper.selectAll(".country")
            .data(geoJSON)
            .enter()
            .append("path")
            .attr("class", "country")
            .attr("d", path)    

          </pre>

          <h4>As there are over 20000 routes and 5000 bus stops to plot, i chose to render them with Canvas rather than SVG. Canvas prevents memory and performance issues in plotting large amount of elements. However, because I want to overlay the elements on top of the map (which is an SVG object), i had to create an embedded Canvas in the SVG map.</h4>

          <h3>Select a bus service number and direction to visualize its route. This will clear out the map and only show one route.</h3>
