            <p>The graph network below use figures from a dataset of every confirmed COVID-19 case announced since January 24, 2020 when the countryâ€™s first case was reported, to March 23, 2020. The data tracks confirmed cases by gender, age, status, source of infection and other information published in case reports and official press releases from <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19" target="_blank">Singapore's Ministry of Health</a> (MOH). I created an animation to track the growth and spread of COVID-19 cases over two months (Jan 24 to March 23, with the network helping to visualize the relationships between cases.</p>

          <p>With the timeline animation, it is possible to track which cases were initially unlinked and eventually discovered to belong to a new cluster by the movement of nodes and simultaneous creation of edges. It can be observed that there are distinct phases in Singapore's growth trajectory of COVID-19 cases. The first locally transmitted case was announced on Feb 4. Since then small clusters of local transmission have emerged, but the outbreak was still kept under control. As COVID-19 spread globally, imported cases in Singapore surged due to a spike in travellers returning to Singapore, particularly from the United Kingdom. It certainly felt alarming to see how the empty canvas was gradually filled up with hundreds of nodes!</p>
